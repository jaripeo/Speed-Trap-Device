# Speed-Trap-Device

A customizable speed measurement system designed for accurately detecting and displaying object speeds, with real-time indicators, alerts, and remote communication capabilities.

# Features

• Speed Measurement: Utilizes LED light sources and phototransistor detectors to calculate the speed of objects passing between sensors.

• Real-Time Indicators: Includes an LED for active measurement status, an LCD to display time and speed, and a dial-type speedometer for intuitive feedback.

• Customizable Threshold: Allows users to set and adjust speed thresholds via a knob, with the current threshold displayed on an LCD screen.

• Alerts: Equipped with a buzzer that triggers an alarm when the speed exceeds the set threshold.

• Remote Communication: Supports RS-232 serial interface for sending speed data to remote units, enabling remote monitoring.

• Visual Feedback: RGB LEDs provide a visual comparison of speed measurements between the local and remote devices.
